# Assessment
The repo contains the readme file and a folder named Assessment in which there is a Python script Prompt.py. I wrote a class and the code is all ready to go. Run the code and enter the string you like. The first output is the first character that is not repeated. And the second output is the reordered input by their occurrence and original order.
